## clipboardSync
Python code to synchronize data in wl-clipboard and xsel clipboard. Created this in response to a nvim glitch that occured when using hyprland.
The glitch caused failure of nvim to use wl-clipboard during hyprland session, while xsel was still in active use. This prevented sharing of data
between system clipboard and nvim.
